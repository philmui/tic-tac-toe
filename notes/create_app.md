Create a classic "tic-tac-toe" game that looks modern and cool by using a team of agents.  The game is a single HTML page Typescript based game that can run by simply loading the HTML page to a browser.

One of the player for this game is the computer.  Let the user choose whether they want to have "X" or "O" and whether the computer goes first or not.  Also, move the scoreboard to the left of the tic-tac-toe board.

**Team Structure & Workflow:**

1. **DesignAgent** - uses latest modern CSS/TailwindCSS/Bootstrap frontend technology to design a single-page (HTML) game with:
   - Beautiful, responsive UI with smooth animations
   - Clear visual feedback for game states (win, draw, player turns)
   - Modern color scheme and typography
   - Mobile-friendly design

2. **CodingAgent** - code & implements the game using best OOP practices:
   - Clean separation of concerns (Game logic, UI, State management)
   - Modular, reusable components
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Pure JavaScript (no framework dependencies unless specified)

3. **CriticAgent** - as an expert architect and engineering critic, reviews all design and code for:
   - Modularity and separation of concerns
   - Extensibility (easy to add features like AI opponent, score tracking)
   - Robustness (error handling, edge cases)
   - Code quality and maintainability

4. **DocAgent** - Creates comprehensive documentation in the ‘docs” folder:
   - User guide with gameplay instructions
   - Developer documentation explaining architecture
   - Code comments and JSDoc annotations
   - README with setup and customization instructions

5. **TestAgent** - Develops and executes comprehensive tests:
   - Unit tests for game logic
   - Integration tests for UI interactions
   - Edge case testing (invalid moves, game state transitions)
   - Test report with coverage analysis

**Workflow:**
- Each agent should use the most relevant SKILL.md file located in “.claude”.
- Agents collaborate sequentially: Design → Code → Critic → Doc → Test
- Each agent reviews previous work and provides feedback
