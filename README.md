- **No dependencies** - Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; no build tools required

## Quick Start

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Select a game mode from the mode selection overlay and click **Start Game**.

That's it. No install, no build step, no server required.

```bash
# Or serve locally (optional)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Open http://localhost:8000
```

## How to Play

### Mode Selection

When the game loads (or when you click **New Game**), a mode selection overlay appears:

1. **Game Mode** - Choose **vs Human** for two-player local or **vs Computer** to play against the AI.
2. **Play as** (AI mode only) - Choose **X (First)** to go first or **O (Second)** to let the computer go first.
3. **Difficulty** (AI mode only) - Choose **Easy**, **Medium**, or **Hard**.
4. Click **Start Game** to begin.

### Gameplay

1. **Player X** goes first. Click any empty cell to place your mark.
2. In human mode, **Player O** takes the next turn. In AI mode, the computer moves automatically.
3. The first player to get **three in a row** (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) wins.
4. If all nine cells are filled with no winner, the game is a **draw**.
5. Click **New Game** to return to mode selection, or **Play Again** to rematch with the same settings.
6. Click **Reset Scores** to zero out the scoreboard.

### AI Difficulty Levels

| Level  | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| Easy   | Random moves only |
| Medium | 60% optimal moves, 40% random |
| Hard   | Always plays the optimal move (unbeatable) |

## Browser Compatibility

| Browser            | Version | Status      |
|--------------------|---------|-------------|
| Chrome / Edge      | 88+     | Supported   |

Requires support for CSS custom properties, CSS Grid, `aspect-ratio`, `backdrop-filter`, and ES6 classes.

## Customization

The game uses CSS custom properties (design tokens) for all visual styling. You can restyle the entire game by editing the `:root` block in `index.html`. See [CUSTOMIZATION.md](docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md) for a full guide.

Quick example - change Player X's color to purple:

```css
:root {
  --color-accent-x: #a78bfa;
  --color-accent-x-glow: rgba(167, 139, 250, 0.4);
}
```
